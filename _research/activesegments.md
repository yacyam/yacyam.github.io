Submitted to HotOS '25 as a co-author with Professor Robbert van Renesse. 
It describes a complete redesign of the virtual memory abstraction stack 
of a traditional operating system that moves page fault and revocation events 
to user space. The key innovation is to enable developers to control 
virtual memory events per segment, known as *segment processes*.

The paper was rejected, but I hope it is still an interesting read.
